> A Python-based modular cognitive agent integrating perception, attention, memory, and decision-makingâ€”designed for future deployment on neuromorphic platforms like **Intel Loihi** and **SpiNNaker**.

---

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This project proposes a biologically-inspired **Cognitive AI Agent** that mimics human decision-making processes using modular cognitive components and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Built using Python and **BindsNET**, the agent is tested in environments like GridWorld and CartPole, and its architecture is designed to be portable to neuromorphic systems.
